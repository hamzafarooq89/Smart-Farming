Smart Farming Crop Yield Prediction/Forecasting 
Facing the challenge of fulfilling the food requirements of a global population exceeding 8 billion, the agricultural sector is increasingly relying on smart farming and machine learning for optimizing crop yields. This strategy emphasizes informed crop selection by considering soil conditions, climate, and geographical factors. Traditional farming techniques often fail to keep pace with these changing variables, resulting in decreased yields. Recent research focuses on enhancing crop yield prediction models through machine learning, striving for precision and identifying areas for future advancements. This effort is vital for selecting the right crops at the right time to maximize yield and meet evolving consumer needs and preferences.
